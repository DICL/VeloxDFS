BRIEFING
========

EclipseDFS is a decentralized distributed file system based on Chord DHT. 

Key features of current EclipseDFS include:
 - There's no central directory service such as HDFS NameNode. 
 - The decentralized file metadata are managed by SQLite in each data node. 
 - It is fault tolerant. (Each block is replicated in successor and decessor by default)
 
Current EclipseDFS does not support update operation as in HDFS, but we are working on it.

USAGE
=====
EclipseDFS default launcher is not included in this repository, if you want to use it you can find it [here][eclipsed].

The reason to not to include the launcher inside the package is to let the user to chose any launcher, options are:
 - systemd/init.d
 - puppet/chef/salt
 
Once the system is running, you can interact with EclipseDFS with the following commands:
```
 $ dfs ls|put|get|rm|format|show
```

COMPILING & INSTALLING
=====================

Compiling requirements
----------------------
 - C++14 support, this is: GCC >= 4.9, Clang >= 3.4, or ICC >= 16.0.
 - Boost library >= 1.53.
 - Sqlite3 library.
 - GNU Autotools (Autoconf, Automake, Libtool).
 - Unittest++ [optional].

For single user installation for developers
-------------------------------------------

    $ mkdir -p local_eclipse/{tmp,sandbox}                 # Create a sandbox directories
    $ cd local_eclipse                                     # enter in the directory
    $ git clone git@github.com:DICL/EclipseDFS.git         # Clone the project from github
    $ cd EclipseDFS
    $ sh autogen.sh                                        # Generate configure script 
    $ cd ../tmp                                            # Go to building folder
    $ sh ../EclipseDFS/configure --prefix=`pwd`/../sandbox # Check requirements and generate the Makefile

    # If you get a boost error go the FAQ section of the README

    ### This last command will be needed whenever you want to recompile the source
    $ make [-j#] install                                   # Compile & install add -j flag to speed up

Now edit in your **~/.bashrc** or **~/.profile**:

    export PATH="/home/*..PATH/To/eclipse/..*/sandbox/bin":$PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH="/home/*..PATH/To/eclipse/..*/sandbox/lib"
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/home/*..PATH/To/eclipse/..*/sandbox/include"
    export MANPATH=`manpath`:/home*..PATH/To/eclipse/..*/sandbox/share/man

For the configuration refer to the manpage:

    $ man eclipsefs

FAQ
---

- _Question_ : `configure` stops with errors related to boost library.
- _Answer_ : It probably means that you do not have boost library installed in
  the default location, in such case you should specify the boost library location.
  ```
  sh ../EclipseDFS/configure --prefix ~/sandbox --with-boost=/usr/local --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib
  ```
  In this example we assume that the boost headers are in `/usr/local/include` while the library files
  are inside `/usr/local/lib`.
